## Hi there! 👋

I'm a principal software engineer on the [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) team at [Posit](https://posit.co/) where we build tools that enable data scientists to more easily develop analytical websites. In addition to contributing to Shiny and the Shiny stack/ecosystem (e.g., [htmltools](https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools), [htmlwidgets](https://github.com/rstudio/htmlwidgets), [sass](https://github.com/rstudio/sass), [bslib](https://github.com/rstudio/bslib), etc), I also maintain the [plotly R package](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R) and have done so for [many years](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/graphs/contributors).

I also:

📚 Wrote a book, ["Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny"](https://plotly-r.com/)

💼 [Consult](https://consulting.cpsievert.me/) to help keep my applied data science skills sharp

🏆 Have a [PhD in statistics](https://www.proquest.com/openview/3a91971f82fd4af20a78bebb079f5035) and have [won awards](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/awards/john-m-chambers) for my contributions to the field.
