## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer on the [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) team at [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio) where we build tools that enable data scientists to more easily develop analytical websites. In addition to contributing to Shiny and the Shiny stack/ecosystem (e.g., [htmltools](https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools), [htmlwidgets](https://github.com/rstudio/htmlwidgets), [sass](https://github.com/rstudio/sass), [bslib](https://github.com/rstudio/bslib), etc), I also maintain the [plotly R package](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R) and have done so for [many years](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/graphs/contributors).

I also:

ðŸ“š Wrote a book, ["Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny"](https://plotly-r.com/)
ðŸ’¼ [Do consulting](https://consulting.cpsievert.me/) to keep my statistical and applied data science skills sharp
ðŸ“ˆ Have a [PhD in statistics](https://www.proquest.com/openview/3a91971f82fd4af20a78bebb079f5035) and have [won awards](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/awards/john-m-chambers) for my contributions to the field.
